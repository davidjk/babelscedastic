==============

This repository was originally created to test the Pelican static blog framework with github pages (since it seems all the cool kids are moving to github these days). The blog html can be found at [davidjk.github.com/babelscedastic/](http://davidjk.github.com/babelscedastic/). At some point I'll use the github service hooks to automatically generate the blog html whenever the repo is updated.

Of course, who knows? Perhaps this blog will take on a life of its own...
